# Stubby

A local DNS and HTTP server combo that provides a package manager
solution to configuring network systems on a development machine. This
is currently only designed to run on OS X.

Use it to:

* manage your dev domains (like pow, with lethal power)

* distribute a spec for your API so developers can run basic tests without
hitting your dev server.

* point a client to the right version of an app without editing a hosts file.

* lock down access to a dev system only to users running a stubby.json config
from your project.

## Installation

Install the stubby gem:

		> $ sudo gem install stubby

## Local Agent (Standard)

                > $ sudo stubby start staging
                > Installing facebook stub...
                > Installing github stub...
                > CTRL-C to exit Stubby

The 'development' and 'staging' modes for this project both require facebook 
in test mode and github in test mode. Our project lives at http://example.com
in production - but we develop on localhost:3000. Don't worry, stubby!

Stubby is running a DNS and HTTP server on your local system that will
appropriately send facebook and github api requests to a local stub, and will
forward all requests to http(s)://example.com to http://localhost:3000 -
perfect for app development.

Just hit CTRL-C to revert your system to normal.

The local agent uses the Stubfile.json file in the working directory, installing
and loading all defined stubs. Use the Stubfile.json file to declare your
environments and their dependencies:

                > $ cd ~/Documents/project && cat Stubfile.json
                > {
                >   "development": {
                >     "dependencies": {
                >       "facebook": "test",
                >       "github": "test"
                >     },
                >
                >     "(https?:\/\/)?example.com": "http://localhost:3000"
                >   },
                > 
                >   "staging": { ... }
                > }

## Stubs

Search for available stubs:


		> $ stubby search
		{ "example" => ... }
		
Install a stub outside of a Stubfile.json dependency list:

		> $ stubby install example

List state of installed stubs:

		> $ stubby list
		> _example_ [staging,production]


## Modes

Each stub can be configured with several modes. By default, a stub 
without a mode is inactive. Use the mode command to set the mode:

		> $ stubby mode example staging
		> _example_ [*staging,production]

The `example` stub is now in staging mode. DNS requests will be routed
against the rules in the `example` stub configuration.

To disable the DNS overrides, use the mode command again with no mode
argument:

		> $ stubby mode example
		> _example_ [staging,production]
	

## Stubbing

A stub is a folder named with the name of the stub that contains a stubby.json file. The stubby.json file contains a hash with the available
modes. Each mode contains a set of rules that define how to route DNS and how to handle potential extension requests (redirects, file server, etc).

Installed stubs are in the ~/.stubby folder:

		> $ ls ~/.stubby 
		> example		system.json

The example folder is the `example` stub, and the system.json file contains the agent configurations. You don't need to manually edit it.

		> $ find ~/.stubby/example
		> ... example
		> ... example/files
		> ... example/hello.html
		> ... example/stubby.json
		
The example/stubby.json file has two modes, staging, and production:

		> cat ~/.stubby/example/stubby.json
		{ "staging": {...}, "production": {...} }

Each environment contains a number of rules:

		{ "staging": {
			"MATCH_REGEXP": "INSTRUCTION"
		} ... }		
		
When a request is made, either DNS or HTTP (important), the request is
compared against the MATCH_REGEXP. If matched, the INSTRUCTION is executed. Since the same rules are consulted for DNS and HTTP, if you are
trying to overwrite a domain, you should make sure the match won't exclude
simply the host. For example, to proxy web traffic from test.example.com
to a server at 10.0.1.5:

		"test.example.com": "http://10.0.1.5"
		
This results in 

		> $ dig test.example.com
		...
		;; ANSWER SECTION:
		test.example.com.   0       IN      A       172.16.123.1
 
172.16.123.1 is the stubby host url (TODO: configurable). All requests
to http://test.example.com are routed to the stubby web server at that
address.
 
		> $ curl test.example.com
 		
Issues a request handled by the stubby web server, which proxies the request to 172.16.123.1.

## Contributing a Stub

Fork this repository, update the index.json file, and submit a pull request. For
this major version, the remote registry will just be the index.json file from
this project's github.

### DNS Only

To simply override DNS for test.example.com, you can create an A record on lookup:

		"test.example.com": "10.0.1.5"		
		
Or a CNAME, if no IP is given:

		"test.example.com": "test.example2.com"
		
But you can be explicit in the INSTRUCTION:

		"test.example.com": "dns-a://10.0.1.5"
		"test.example.com": "dns-cname://test.example2.com"
		
Using the dns-#{name} convention, you can create simple references to 
any dns record type. TODO: need to allow mx record priority somehow.
 
### File Server

Because stubby can intercept HTTP requests, it includes a base set of functionality that allows you two serve files directly from the stub. Given a rule:

		"api.example.com": "file://~/.stubby/example/files"
		
DNS will resolve to the stubby server:

		> $ dig api.example.com
		... 
		api.example.com.   0       IN      A       172.16.123.1
		
And a web request to api.example.com will serve files from the ~/.stubby/example/files directory:

		> $ curl http://api.example.com/hello.html
		> <html><head></head><body>Hello</body></html>

This is designed to allow you to create API stubs (success responses, for instance).


### HTTP Redirects

Given a rule:

		"(https?:\/\/)?yahoo.com": "http-redirect://duckduckgo.com"
		
DNS will resolve to the stubby server, and the web request to http://yahoo.com will redirect to http://duckduckgo.com.

### Vision

* protocol in instruction becomes a plugin system. dns-cname:, for instance,
  could be handled by the dns plugin. If it didn't exist when Stubfile.json was
  being installed, it would be installed. 
* proxy traffic on ports and send to log systems:
  ":25": "log-smtp://"
  ":3306": "log-mysql://"
* web app front-end: show emails sent, mysql queries made, etc.
